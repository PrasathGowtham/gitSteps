Steps about git pull push
This works for any Git repository ‚Äî local or remote (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).

üß† Step-by-Step Git CLI Commands
1Ô∏è‚É£ Check your current branch
git status


‚Üí This shows if you have any uncommitted changes and what branch you‚Äôre on.
If you‚Äôre not sure which branch:

git branch

2Ô∏è‚É£ Stash or commit your local changes

If you have uncommitted changes and want to keep them:

git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"


If you‚Äôre not ready to commit yet:

git stash


(You can reapply later using git stash pop)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Pull the latest code from remote

If you‚Äôre on a feature branch:

git pull origin your-branch-name


If you‚Äôre on main or master:

git pull origin main


‚ö†Ô∏è This merges remote changes into your local branch.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Fix any merge conflicts (if any)

If you see conflicts:

Open the conflicting files (marked with <<<<<<< and >>>>>>>)

Resolve manually
Then run:

git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"

5Ô∏è‚É£ Merge another branch (optional)

If you want to merge another branch into yours:

git merge branch-to-merge


Example:

git merge main

6Ô∏è‚É£ Push your merged code to remote

Once merged and tested:

git push origin your-branch-name


or for main:

git push origin main

üß∞ Optional (for a cleaner workflow)
Rebase instead of merge (for a linear history)
git pull --rebase origin main

Push after rebase
git push origin your-branch-name --force-with-lease


‚ö†Ô∏è Only use --force-with-lease if you‚Äôre sure others haven‚Äôt pushed to the same branch ‚Äî it rewrites commit history safely.
